# Welcome to My Printf
***

## Task
The challege is to code a printf function, without using the built-in function printf

## Description
The key of the solution is the use of the syscall function write. With this syscall function you can use a string and print it on the console


## Installation
gcc -o my_printf my_printf.c
and then,
./my_printf "This is a %d" 1

Note: it works only with one integer

## Usage
As param_1 you should write the string with the specifier
As param_2 you should write the integer you want to print
```
./my_printf param_1 param_2
```
